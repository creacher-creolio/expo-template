# Auth Component Refactoring

This document explains the refactoring done to reduce redundancy in auth components and pages.

## Reusable Components Created

1. **`useAuthForm` Hook** (`hooks/useAuthForm.ts`)
   - Handles form state, validation, error management, and submission
   - Manages input refs and focus handling
   - Provides consistent API for all form fields

2. **`AuthLayout` Component** (`components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx`)
   - Standardizes layout for auth pages
   - Handles title, subtitle, and success message display
   - Manages safe keyboard area and padding
   - Uses consistent spacing with gap-based layout

3. **`EmailInput` Component** (`components/auth/EmailInput.tsx`)
   - Encapsulates email input styling and behavior
   - Handles email-specific keyboard type and auto-capitalization

4. **`PasswordInput` Component** (`components/auth/PasswordInput.tsx`)
   - Handles show/hide password functionality
   - Standardizes password field styling and validation

5. **`FormError` Component** (`components/auth/FormError.tsx`)
   - Displays form-level errors consistently
   - Optionally shows warning icon

6. **`SubmitButton` Component** (`components/auth/SubmitButton.tsx`)
   - Handles loading state
   - Standardizes button styling and text display
   - Includes consistent top margin to maintain spacing from preceding elements

7. **`AuthFooter` Component** (`components/auth/AuthFooter.tsx`)
   - Manages navigation links between auth pages
   - Handles secondary links when needed

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**:
   - Form validation logic is now in one place
   - Input styling and behavior is standardized
   - Navigation patterns are consistent

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Changes to validation rules only need to be made in one place
   - UI updates can be made to components rather than every page

3. **Smaller Page Components**:
   - Auth pages are now ~50-60 lines instead of 150-230 lines
   - Logic is separated into appropriate hooks and components

4. **Consistent User Experience**:
   - Error messages appear in the same place and format
   - Form interactions work the same way across all auth flows
   - Consistent spacing between UI elements for better visual hierarchy

## Pages Refactored

The following pages now use the new components:

- `/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`
- `/app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`
- `/app/(auth)/magic-link.tsx`
- `/app/(auth)/password-reset.tsx`
- `/app/(auth)/set-password.tsx`

The following components have been refactored:

- `/components/auth/UpdatePasswordForm.tsx`
- `/components/auth/UpdateEmailForm.tsx`

## Components Not Refactored

Some components were not refactored because they use different form management approaches or have unique requirements:

- `/components/auth/DeleteAccountForm.tsx` - Uses react-hook-form instead of our custom hook
- `/components/auth/InviteUserForm.tsx` - Has more complex input requirements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Linter Errors**:
   - Fixed React Hook errors in `useAuthForm.ts` by using proper hook patterns
   - Fixed unused variable warnings in component files

2. **Layout/Spacing Issues**:
   - Improved spacing in `AuthLayout.tsx` using flex and gap properties
   - Fixed layout in `AuthFooter.tsx` for better alignment
   - Added consistent margins to SubmitButton component (mt-6)
   - Ensured consistent vertical spacing between all form elements
   - Used a clean gap-based layout approach to ensure consistent spacing
   - Removed redundant spacing classes from individual components
