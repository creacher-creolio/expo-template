- When creating buttons, pressables and other elements with onpress, if placed in a header, such as Stack.Screen options headerRight, use onPressIn instead of onPress
- Use onPressIn for header buttons (e.g., Stack.Screen options headerRight)
- Implement haptic feedback for important interactions using expo-haptics
- Add visual feedback for press states with pressed:className in NativeWind
- Debounce rapid press events to prevent duplicate actions
- Use Pressable over TouchableOpacity for more control over press states
- Implement proper loading states during async onPress operations
- Add accessibility focus states for keyboard navigation
- Ensure press targets are at least 44Ã—44 points for better usability
- Use hitSlop to expand the touchable area of small elements
