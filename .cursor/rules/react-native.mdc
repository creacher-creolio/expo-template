- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Ensure UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- Use Expo SDK features instead of native modules when available
- Handle platform-specific code with Platform.OS or platform-specific file extensions
- Use proper keyboard handling with KeyboardAvoidingView and dismissKeyboard
- Leverage Expo's optimized APIs for notifications, updates, and assets
- Test on both iOS and Android regularly during development
- Prefer FlatList or SectionList over ScrollView for long lists
- Use proper error boundaries for components that fetch data
- Use the components already found in the components folder whenever possible; use NativeWind for styling.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations, gestures & micro-interactions.
