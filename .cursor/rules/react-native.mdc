- Use functional components with React Hooks instead of class components.
- Ensure all navigation-related code uses 'react-navigation' conventions if applicable.
- Include proper error boundaries for components that fetch data.
- Use the components already found in the components folder whenever possible; use NativeWind for styling.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations, gestures & micro-interactions.
