- Use explicit return types for all functions unless the return type is obvious (e.g., simple arrow functions).
- Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions unless type unions or intersections are needed.
- Enforce strong typing. Avoid using "any" type unless absolutely necessary and justified; suggest specific types or generics instead.
- Suggest using optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) where applicable.
