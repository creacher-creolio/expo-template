- First, create a new file in the ~/lib/icons/ directory with the name of the LucideIcon.
- Then, in each file:
    - Import the Icon from LucideIcon
    - Import the iconWithClassName function
    - Call the iconWithClassName function and pass the icon as its argument
    - Export the Icon as a named export
- Then, when importing/referring to the icon in other files, try to use NativeWind classes to define both light and dark mode colors
