## Architecture
- Create purpose-specific components that do one thing well
- Split components into smaller ones if they exceed 150 lines
- Export components individually from barrel files (index.ts)
- Never modify components in the ui/ directory directly; create wrappers

## Implementation
- Implement TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Add appropriate accessibility attributes (accessible, accessibilityLabel)
- Apply React Native Reusables when available
- Implement loading, error, and empty states for data-dependent components

## Performance
- Use React.memo() for expensive components that re-render often
- Avoid anonymous function creation in render methods
- Implement proper memoization for callbacks and derived values
