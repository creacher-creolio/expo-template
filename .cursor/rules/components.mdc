- Never add to nor edit components in the components/ui folder directly. If needed, create a wrapper component. 
- All reusable components must accept a 'props' interface with explicit TypeScript types.
- Suggest splitting large components into smaller, reusable ones if they exceed 150 lines.
- Include defaultProps or optional props with sensible defaults where applicable.
- Export reusable components individually from an index file (e.g., export { AppButton } from './AppButton').
