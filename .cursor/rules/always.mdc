- Use kebab-case for file/folder names, PascalCase for component names and camelCase for variables/functions
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Adhere to the prettier formatting rules found in .prettierrc.js
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious code
- Follow consistent file structure: 'app/', 'components/', 'utils/', 'hooks/', etc.
- Use absolute imports with '@/' prefix (e.g., 'import { AppButton } from '@/components')
- Ensure accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and React Native accessibility props
- Optimize for both light and dark themes using NativeWind's dark: prefix
