## Code Style
- Use kebab-case for file/folder names, PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions
- Keep files under 200 lines and functions under 10 lines
- Use meaningful variable names (10-30 chars) with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Place important functions at the top, subfunctions below
- Add file path comment at the top of each file

## Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious code
- All non-self-explanatory functions should have brief explanatory comments
- Preserve existing comments unless obsolete

## Project Structure
- Follow structure: 'app/', 'components/', 'utils/', 'hooks/', etc.
- Use absolute imports with '@/' prefix (import { Button } from '@/components')

## Development
- Adhere to prettier formatting rules in .prettierrc.js
- Ensure a11y standards with ARIA roles and React Native accessibility props
- Check for type issues after making changes
- Add micro interactions to UI elements
- Use package versions specified in package.json/requirements.txt

## Environment
- Use PowerShell syntax for terminal commands on Windows
- Use pnpm instead of npm
